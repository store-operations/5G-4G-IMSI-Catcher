LTE 4G IMSI Catcher / Detector

We will provide service for our close proximity and passive 5G + 4G IMSI Catcher / Detector from X-Surveillance which we use for Operations Security.

The 5G + 4G IMSI Catcher / Detector works passively which means it does not intercept any data. So no information such as voice, text, mail or web traffic is collected from the suspect. Thus, X-Surveillance's passive 5G + 4G IMSI Catcher / Detector works completely passively as it does not intercept.

The 5G + 4G IMSI Catcher / Detector is supplied by us to organizations that want to better protect their assets. We will upload Add-On files here that can be used for updates and upgrades of the existing X-Surveillance 5G + 4G IMSI Catcher / Detectors which have been further developed for Asset Protection, Perimeter Protection and Property Protection.

If you would like to know more about the technology, please contact the supplier X-Surveillance, which offers the 5G + 4G IMSI Catchers or 5G + 4G IMSI Detectors.

We will only offer Add-Ons for Asset Protection, Perimeter Protection and Property Protection.

We will keep you informed.
